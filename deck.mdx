- We got this awesome React project that is all Apollo and GraphQL, want to help?
- That sounds awesome. What do you use for state management?
- Redux.

# Why?

---

# GQL ALL THE THINGS

---

<img src={require('file-loader!./images/website.png')} />

---

# How?

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code/install.js')}
  lang="bash"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code/provider.js')}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# Done

---

# Now state

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code/state.js')}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# defaults

Your base state. What you start with

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code/defaults.js')}
  lang="js"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# resolvers

This is here all the magic happens to retrieve and update your local data in the Apollo cache

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code/resolvers.js')}
  lang="js"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# The mutation

You know â€¦ The GQL part of the equation

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code/mutation.js')}
  lang="js"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# The query

You know â€¦ The other GQL part of the equation

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code/query.js')}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# We made the behind the scenes

How do you actually call these things?

---

# THE QUERY COMPONENT

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code/query-react.js')}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# CAN WE MAKE THIS SMALLER?

---

# HELL YEAH

## LETâ€™S CREATE OUR VERY OWN QUERY COMPONENT

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/query-ours.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---

# OUR CODE NOW

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/query-small.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---

# Fits one slide

---

# BUT NO MODAL :(

---

# THE mutation COMPONENT

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/mutation-react.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---

# STILL THINK ITâ€™S TOO MUCH CODE?

---

# APOLLO CONSUMER

Used for very simple mutations to the cache

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/consumer.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---
# Where is the mutation?

Itâ€™s done on the fly! No need to define it before ðŸŽ‰

---

# Can you make the query and mutation in one slide?

---

# Watch me

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/all.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---

# The modal does not close

---

# Fineâ€¦

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/final.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
