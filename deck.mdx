* We got this awesome React project that is all Apollo and GraphQ, want to help?
* That sounds awesome. What do you use for state management?
* Redux.

# Why?

# GQL ALL THE THINGS

---

# How?

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/provider.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# Done

---

# Now state

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/state.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---


# defaults
Your base state. What you start with

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/defaults.js")}
  lang="js"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# resolvers
This is here all the magic happens to retrieve and update your local data in the Apollo cache

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/resolvers.js")}
  lang="js"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# The mutation

You know … The GQL part of the equation

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/mutation.js")}
  lang="js"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# The query

You know … The GQL part of the equation


---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/query.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# We made the behind the scenes

How do you actually call these things?

---

# THE QUERY COMPONENT

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/query-react.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

---

# CAN WE MAKE THIS SMALLER?

---

# HELL YEAH
## LET’S CREATE OUR VERY OWN QUERY COMPONENT

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/query-ours.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---

# OUR CODE NOW

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/query-small.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---

# Fits one slide

---

# BUT NO MODAL :(

---

# THE mutation COMPONENT

---
<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/mutation-react.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---

# STILL THINK IT’S TOO MUCH CODE?

---

# APOLLO CONSUMER
Used for very simple mutations to the cache

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/consumer.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---
# Where is the mutation?

It’s done on the fly! No need to define it before 🎉

---

# Can you make the query and mutation in one slide?

---

# Watch me

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/all.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>
---

# The modal does not close

---

# Fine…


---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./code/final.js")}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}

# NEW APOLLO THINGS

# The Apollo CLI


```notes
Apollo CLI brings together your GraphQL clients and servers with tools for validating your schema, linting your operations for compatibility with your server, and generating static types for improved client-side type safety.
```

# Opt-in schema validation
With typescript
